Zillow Data Entry Script using BeautifulSoup, Selenium and Google Forms

**Overview**

This Python script uses BeautifulSoup to scrape rental listings from a Zillow-like platform based on defined search criteria (location, price range, and minimum number of bedrooms). The collected data is automatically submitted into a Google Form, allowing you to generate a spreadsheet for further analysis without manual data entry.

**Features**

- Scrapes rental listings according to filters (location, price, number of bedrooms).
- Extracts key details: price, address, and listing link.
- Automates data entry by submitting results directly into a Google Form.
- Syncs seamlessly with Google Sheets for structured analysis.
- Leverages Selenium to handle navigation, form filling, and submission automatically.
